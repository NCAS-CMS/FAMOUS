FTP Note, figlet release 2.2, 6 January 1996
-------------------------------------------------

Note: figlet 2.2 is a moderate revision of figlet 2.1.2, adding
several new features: compressed font files, Shift-JIS and Unicode
support, a new control file format, and forced smushing.
In addition, the font standard.flf has been upgraded to include
all the Latin-2, Latin-3, Latin-4, and Latin-5 characters.
A set of ".flc" files (usable only with the new release)
are also available for supporting the Latin-* standards
(Latin-1 is already there).


These changes were made by John Cowan <cowan@ccil.org>.

For those making figlet 2.2 available by anonymous FTP: please put
the version number (2.2) in the filename, so that FTP'ers can know
they're not getting the same program they already have.

Also, for those who maintain archives of figlet fonts, please note that
all of the standard fonts have been changed, as of release 2.1, to
include non-ASCII characters.  These fonts are the following:

big.flf (also contains Greek)
banner.flf (also contains Cyrillic and Japanese katakana)
block.flf
bubble.flf
digital.flf
ivrit.flf (right-to-left, also contains Hebrew)
lean.flf
mini.flf
script.flf
shadow.flf
slant.flf
small.flf
smscript.flf
smshadow.flf
smslant.dld
standard.flf
term.flf

The new versions of these fonts can be identified by the words "figlet
release 2.1" somewhere in the first few lines.  These fonts are
included in the standard figlet 2.2 package, and are also available by
anonymous FTP from "ftp.nicoh.com", in directory "pub/figlet/fonts/ours".
