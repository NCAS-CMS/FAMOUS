      INTEGER NCLDS                                                        NCLDSVAL.2     
C     !  Number of potentially cloudy levels - must be set as              NCLDSVAL.3     
C     !   a PARAMETER to get FORTRAN (when code has been obtained          NCLDSVAL.4     
C     !   with UPDATE *DEF CRAY not set).                                  NCLDSVAL.5     
      There is no appropriate default value.  The UPDATE to set a value    NCLDSVAL.6     
 should be "*D NCLDSVAL.6,7" followed by the PARAMETER line & a comment.   NCLDSVAL.7
