!  This routine provides a BUFFOUT routine for the Parallel Unified        PBFOUT1A.11    
!  Model. It is used where the same data has to be written out from        PBFOUT1A.12    
!  all processors. (Contrasting with WRITE_MULTI where each                PBFOUT1A.13    
!  processor writes its own local data to a larger global field).          PBFOUT1A.14

!  The C BUFFOUT is renamed BUFFOUT_SINGLE under *DEF,MPP. This            PBFOUT1A.17    
!  routine causes BUFFOUT_SINGLE to be called by PE 0 only.                PBFOUT1A.18    
!  Note : No check is made that all processors are attempting              PBFOUT1A.19    
!         to write out identical data. It is assumed that the              PBFOUT1A.20
