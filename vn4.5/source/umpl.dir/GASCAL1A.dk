CLL                                                                        GASCAL1A.21    
CLL Purpose :                                                              GASCAL1A.22    
CLL   Calculates the trace gas mixing ratio (or weighting factor for       GASCAL1A.23    
CLL aerosol forcing fields.  Rates of increase (yearly compound factors)   AWI1F403.358   
CLL can be supplied, or spot values (which will be linearly                GASCAL1A.25    
CLL interpolated) or a mixture of these.  It is designed so it can be      GASCAL1A.26    
CLL called each time step, but when rates of increase are being used,      GASCAL1A.27    
CLL values are in fact only updated at New Year.                           GASCAL1A.28    
CLL The rules are:                                                         GASCAL1A.29    
CLL   If rates exist (i.e. are positive) for the first & current years     AWI1F403.359   
CLL then all concentrations are ignored, except for the initial value.     GASCAL1A.31    
CLL   If there is a positive rate for the current year but not for the     AWI1F403.360   
CLL start, the current rate & most recent concentration are used.          GASCAL1A.33    
CLL   If rates do not exist for the current year then the concentration    GASCAL1A.34    
CLL is calculated by linear interpolation between the concentrations at    GASCAL1A.35    
CLL the given years.                                                       GASCAL1A.36    
CLL   The mixing ratios calculated after the last given year use the       GASCAL1A.37    
CLL rate for the final given year.                                         GASCAL1A.38    
CLL   The 360-day year is assumed.                                         GASCAL1A.39    
CLL CARE should be taken if solitary rates are specified, as this can      GASCAL1A.40    
CLL result in discontinuities in the concentration time profile at         GASCAL1A.41
