      INTEGER NWET                                                         NWETVAL.2     
C     !  Number of levels where water vapour is input - must be set as     NWETVAL.3     
C     !   a PARAMETER to get FORTRAN (when code has been obtained          NWETVAL.4     
C     !   with UPDATE *DEF CRAY not set).                                  NWETVAL.5     
      There is no appropriate default value.  The UPDATE to set a value    NWETVAL.6     
 should be "*D NWETVAL.6,7" followed by the PARAMETER line & a comment.    NWETVAL.7
