!   COPYODIAGL copies the data from the input 2D or 3D DATA array to       COPYODL1.11    
!   the 1D STASHWORK array, in which they are arranged in the normal       COPYODL1.12    
!   Fortran order. It imposes a missing-data mask according to the         COPYODL1.13    
!   logical OCEAN mask array, which has the same dimensions as             COPYODL1.14    
!   DATA. Elements which are .FALSE. in the mask result in missing data    COPYODL1.15    
!   in STASHWORK. If the ocean is cyclic, it is assumed that the last      COPYODL1.16    
!   two columns of DATA (NX-1:NX) are wrap-round columns, which are not    COPYODL1.17    
!   copied to STASHWORK. If STDVMD is .TRUE., missing data is indicated    COPYODL1.18    
!   by the standard missing data value. If STDVMD is .FALSE., the value    COPYODL1.19    
!   of VMD is inserted at missing-data points.                             COPYODL1.20

!   The ...L suffix of the subroutine name indicates that the data is      COPYODL1.24    
!   being masked with a LOGICAL mask. The corresponding routine which      COPYODL1.25
