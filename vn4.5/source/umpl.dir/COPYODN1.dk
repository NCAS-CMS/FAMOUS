!   COPYODIAGN copies the data from the input 2D or 3D DATA array to       COPYODN1.11    
!   the 1D STASHWORK array, in which they are arranged in the normal       COPYODN1.12    
!   Fortran order. The data in STASHWORK is masked according to the        COPYODN1.13    
!   supplied number-of-levels array FKM. FKM is a 2D array. In the case    COPYODN1.14    
!   of a cylic ocean, the last two columns of FKM (NX-1:NX) correspond     COPYODN1.15    
!   to wrap-round columns, and are ignored. STASHWORK contains data for    COPYODN1.16    
!   row of length NX-2 in this case. If STDVMD is .TRUE., missing data     COPYODN1.17    
!   is indicated by the standard missing data value. If STDVMD is          COPYODN1.18    
!   .FALSE., the value of VMD is inserted at missing-data points.          COPYODN1.19    
                                                                           COPYODN1.20

!   The ...N suffix of the subroutine name indicates that the data is      COPYODN1.23    
!   being masked with a number-of-levels array. The corresponding          COPYODN1.24    
!   routine which masks with a logical array is called COPYODIAGL. A       COPYODN1.25
