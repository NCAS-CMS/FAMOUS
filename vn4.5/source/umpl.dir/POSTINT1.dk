CLL   onto the target grid.                                                POSTINT1.10

CLL   In the first step, values at points on the source grid (the          POSTINT1.12    
CLL   input to H_INT) are used to replace output values at coastal         POSTINT1.13    
CLL   points identified by COAST_AJ, provided the source grid point        POSTINT1.14    
CLL   selected by COAST_AJ is a sea point on that grid. Otherwise          POSTINT1.15    
CLL   missing data is substituted. In the second step, the final           POSTINT1.16    
CLL   set of values are written to the appropriate locations in the        POSTINT1.17    
CLL   target grid. (The interpolation routine H_INT does not use a         POSTINT1.18    
CLL   target grid explicitly, but a set of target points instead.)         POSTINT1.19    
CLL   Missing data values are not transferred.                             POSTINT1.20
