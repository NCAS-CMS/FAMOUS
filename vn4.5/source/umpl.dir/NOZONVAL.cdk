      INTEGER NOZONE                                                       NOZONVAL.2     
C     !  Number of levels where ozone is input - must be set as            NOZONVAL.3     
C     !   a PARAMETER to get FORTRAN (when code has been obtained          NOZONVAL.4     
C     !   with UPDATE *DEF CRAY not set).                                  NOZONVAL.5     
      There is no appropriate default value.  The UPDATE to set a value    NOZONVAL.6     
 should be "*D NOZONVAL.6,7" followed by the PARAMETER line & a comment.   NOZONVAL.7
