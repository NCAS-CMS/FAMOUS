CLL purpose: Generate extra data for the timeseries.                       EXTTS1A.5     
CLL This extra data provides information about what processing was done    EXTTS1A.6     
CLL to produce the timeseries. This information will hopefully be of som   EXTTS1A.7     
CLL use to users doing further processing of the timeseries data.          EXTTS1A.8     
CLL This deck contains two subroutines                                     EXTTS1A.9     
CLL (1) EXTRA_TS_INFO : which generates the codes and sets up the space    EXTTS1A.10    
CLL                   : for the extra data.                                EXTTS1A.11

CLL (2) EXTRA_MAKE_VECTOR: which computes the long/latt ht domain info     EXTTS1A.13    
CLL                   : and puts that into the correct place in the        EXTTS1A.14    
CLL                   : extra data                                         EXTTS1A.15

CLL To some extent this routine has much in common with the                EXTTS1A.18    
CLL multi_spatial routine but as it has a different function               EXTTS1A.19    
CLL viz generate info on timeseries rather than generating a single time   EXTTS1A.20    
CLL for the timeseries it is coded separately.                             EXTTS1A.21    
CLL when modifying multi_spatial be sure also to modify this routine and   EXTTS1A.22    
CLL vice versa                                                             EXTTS1A.23
